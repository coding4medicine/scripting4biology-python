# Introduction

A scientific field is defined by the questions asked by its practitioners. Unless life scientists with experimental training start 
analyzing their own data, their whole field may get redefined by the computational scientists interested in a different kind of questions.  
For example, a person trained in computer science wants to find problems, where they can show the mastery of their computer
skills. They may not ask questions that could be easily answered by additional experiments, because they do not have the access to 
experimental facilities.  One can see such change happening in the field of human genetics, where researchers are proposing larger
and larger genome sequencing problems (1,000, 10,000 or 100,000 human genomes) to answer increasing trifling questions.

On the other hand, it is not possible for traditional geneticists trained with working on individual genes to ignore the 
large-scale datasets available in the post-genomic era.  The completion of genome sequencing projects and decrease in 
sequencing cost made genome-wide experiments possible, thus leading to an exponential growth in the amount of biological data in 
the public databases.  What is less recognized is that the quality of individual observations  
continues to fall with this exponential rise of data.  For example, in the 90s, protein-protein interactions were measured
at the individual gene level, but each observation reported in papers were of high-quality. Since 2000, several groups reported 
measuring protein-protein interactions at the genome-wide scale, thus giving us thousands of interaction pairs.  It turned out that 
each interaction pair in their massive data sets were noisier than more careful individualized measurements of the earlier era. 
The same is true for all kinds of large-scale data sets published since the late 90s.

The biology of new era will consist of asking biological questions, but answering them through a combination of traditional experiments
and computational/statistical analysis of high-throughput datasets. This book prepares the biologists for the second task.
