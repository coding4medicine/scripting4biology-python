# Debugging


Each time you are adding the string at the end, your variable gets a bit bigger on the paper, right?
So, if you want to keep track of it, after first few lines, you realize that you do not have enough space. So, you copy that particular variable in a new page and then erase the old copy.
Again you are adding more and more text at the end of the variable. Once again you run out of space. So, copy everything in an even bigger paper, and erase the old variable.
This copy and erase part will take a while, when you have, say, 300 characters, right?
The same physical process is taking place in the computer except that it gets tired with bigger string than you doing manually.

Regarding the error in the code, it fails at the absolutely last line of the FASTA file.
